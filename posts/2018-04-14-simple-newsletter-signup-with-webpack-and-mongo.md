In this cloudy saturday ðŸŒ§, I took sometime to ship a new feature for my blog engine in **Node.js**: I included a simple newsletter sign-up form that uses **Webpack 4.5.0** to bundle a class written in ECMAScript 2016 and communicates with a self-contained API in the blog engine that writes that information in a MongoDB instance.

Check out [my pull request](https://github.com/thiagoricieri/thiago.ricieri.com/pull/1) to see what has changed. I've called this feature *Penpals* and anybody that signs in will receive a direct e-mail from me, just for fun.

I think the next enhancement in this feature will be to add a notification service to let me know when a new email is subscribed, so I can easily start conversations on my inbox ðŸ“¬.
