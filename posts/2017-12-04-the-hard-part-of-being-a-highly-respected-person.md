Yesterday, I save an article about [7 Qualities of People Who Are Highly Respected](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271849). Although the _click-bait-ish_ title, the story is good. I kept it a while ago, and I didn’t remember. It was an excellent refresher of how difficult some things are in day-by-day life.

From the list, I think I have the most difficulty in **listening well** and **letting go of anger**.

One characteristic I try to change in myself every day is to pay attention to what other people have to say, genuinely. Most of the time is not disrespect; it is that I have my mind in so many things, so many thoughts that I find difficult to focus on something outside my head. Thankfully, practicing meditation every day is helping me to overcome this challenge.

As for letting go of anger, I’m a very calm person, **to everybody else.** Inside my head, I’m on fire sometimes due to some opinions, but I chose to remain quiet. Perhaps that’s the first step towards truthfully letting go of anger, or maybe I am just suppressing it until it explodes.

Nevertheless, I believe to be respectful to others is a must-have quality in today’s world. One should practice it tenaciously. I’m doing my part.
